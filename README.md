A mobile and web app that collects user information about products through an engaging game experience.

### What it does
Players choose categories of real products based on their personal interests and are asked to guess the price of each item. They are awarded points based on how close their estimate was to the actual price which in the end of the session can be used to acquire product discounts. After the game they are asked to rate each item on a scale of love it to hate it and are able to provide feedback and add items to their cart for purchase. Pinder works because it combines incentive with personal interest while at the same time helping companies collect needed information.
### How we built it
We used a bare bones bootstrap template to help us get started. In developing our app, we looked at two popular social media platforms and tried to integrate them into an interactive and user-friendly game that people would want to play. We used Firebase to host our app and store server side data.
