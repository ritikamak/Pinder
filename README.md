A mobile and web application that collects user information about products through an engaging game experience. Allows a player to review a name, description, and picture of a product, set a price for what an average consumer would pay for it, indicate sentiment (positive and negative), and add comments.

## What it does:
Players choose categories of real products based on their personal interests and are asked to guess the price of each item. They are awarded points based on how close their estimate was to the actual price which in the end of the session can be used to acquire product discounts. After the game they are asked to rate each item on a scale of love it to hate it and are able to provide feedback and add items to their cart for purchase. Pinder works because it combines incentive with personal interest while at the same time helping companies collect needed information.
## How we built it:
We used a bare bones bootstrap template to help us get started. In developing our app, we looked at two popular social media platforms and tried to integrate them into an interactive and user-friendly game that people would want to play. We used Firebase to host our app and store server side data.
### Functional requirements:
* The player should be presented with one item at a time. 
* The player should be able to view item description.
* The player should be able to view all images for an item.
* The player should be able to set a price for the item.
* The player should be able to set sentiment for an item.
* The player should be able to add comments for an item.
### Non-functional requirements:
* Click through rate per player should be greater than or equal to 90%; we want to make sure that the user stays engaged to review all items (max of 15) and not drop off in the middle.
